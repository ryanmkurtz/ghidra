# 4. Basic Definitions

SLEIGH files must start with all the definitions needed by the rest of the specification. All
definition statements start with the keyword **define** and end with a semicolon ‘;’.

## 4.1. Endianness Definition

The first definition in any SLEIGH specification must be for endianness. Either

<pre>define endian=big;            <i>OR</i>
define endian=little;</pre>

This defines how the processor interprets contiguous sequences of bytes as integers or other values
and globally affects values across all address spaces. It also affects how integer fields within an
instruction are interpreted, (see [Section 6.1, “Defining Tokens and
Fields”](sleigh_tokens.md#61-defining-tokens-and-fields)), although it is possible to override this
setting in the rare case that endianness is different for data versus instruction encoding. The
specification designer generally only needs to worry about endianness when labeling instruction
fields and when defining overlapping registers, otherwise the specification language hides
endianness issues.

## 4.2. Alignment Definition

An alignment definition looks like

<pre>define alignment=<b>integer</b>;</pre>

This specifies the byte alignment of instructions within their address space. It defaults to 1 or no
alignment. When disassembling an instruction at a particular address, the disassembler checks the
alignment of the address against this value and can opt to flag an unaligned instruction as an
error.

## 4.3. Space Definitions

The definition of an address space looks like

<pre>define space <b>spacename attributes</b> ;</pre>

The *spacename* is the name of the new space, and *attributes* looks like one or more of the
following lines:

<pre>type=(ram_space|register_space)
size=<b>integer</b>
default
wordsize=<b>integer</b></pre>

The only required attribute is **size** which specifies the number of bytes needed to address any
byte within the space, for example a 32-bit address space has size 4.

A space of type **ram_space** is defined as follows:

* It is read/write.
* It is part of the standard memory map of the processor.
* It is addressable in the sense that the processor may load and store from dynamic pointers into
  the space.

A space of type **register_space** is intended to model the processor’s general-purpose registers.
In terms of accessing and manipulating data within the space, SLEIGH and p-code make no distinction
between the type **ram_space** or the type **register_space**. But there are still some
distinguishing properties of a space labeled with **register_space**.

* It is read/write.
* It is *not* part of the standard memory map of the processor.
* In terms of GHIDRA, there will not be separate windows for the space and references into the space
  will not be stored.
* Named symbols within the space will have Register objects associated with them in GHIDRA.
* It is *not* addressable. Data-flow analysis will assume that data within the space cannot be
  manipulated indirectly via pointer, so there is no pointer aliasing. Make sure this is true!

At least one space needs to be labeled with the **default** attribute. This should be the space that
the processor accesses with its main address bus. In terms of the rest of the specification file,
this sets the default space referred to by the ‘\*’ operator (see [Section 7.7.1.2, “The '\*'
Operator”](sleigh_constructors.md#7712-the--operator)). It also has meaning to GHIDRA.

The average 32-bit processor requires only the following two space definitions.

```
define space ram type=ram_space size=4 default;
define space register type=register_space size=4;
```

The **wordsize** attribute can be used to specify the size of the memory location referred to with a
single address. If a space has **wordsize** two, then each address of the space refers to 16 bits of
data, rather than 8 bits. If the space has **size** two, then there are still 2<sup>16</sup>
different addresses, but since each address accesses two bytes, there are twice as many bytes,
2<sup>17</sup>, in the space. If the **wordsize** attribute is not specified, the size of a memory
location defaults to one byte (8 bits).

## 4.4. Naming Registers

The general purpose registers of the processors can be named with the following define syntax:

<pre>define <b>spacename</b> offset=<b>integer</b> size=<b>integer stringlist</b> ;</pre>

A *stringlist* is either a single string or a white space separated list of strings in square
brackets ‘\[’ and ‘\]’. A string of just “\_” indicates a skip in the sequence for that definition.
The offset corresponding to that position in the list of names will not have a varnode defined at
it.

This defines specific varnodes within the indicated address space. Each name in the list is assigned
to a varnode in turn starting at the indicated offset within the space. Each varnode occupies the
indicated number of bytes in size. There is no restriction on size, and by reusing the same offset
in different **define** statements, overlapping varnodes are allowed. This is most often used to
give registers their standard names but could be used to label any semantic variable that might need
to be accessed globally by the processor. Overlapping register sequences like the x86 EAX/AX/AL can
be easily modeled with overlapping varnode definitions.

Here is a typical example of register definition:

```
define register offset=0 size=4
    [EAX ECX EDX EBX ESP EBP ESI EDI ];
define register offset=0 size=2
    [AX _ CX _ DX _ BX _ SP _ BP _ SI _ DI];
define register offset=0 size=1
    [AL AH _ _ CL CH _ _ DL DH _ _ BL BH ];
```

## 4.5. Bit Range Registers

Many processors define registers that either consist of a single bit or otherwise don't use an
integral number of bytes. A recurring example in many processors is the status register which is
further subdivided into the overflow and result flags for the arithmetic instructions. These flags
typically have labels like ZF for the zero flag or CF for the carry flag and can be considered
logical registers contained within the status register. SLEIGH allows registers to be defined like
this using the **define bitrange** statement, but there are some important caveats with its use. A
bit register like this is problematic for the underlying p-code instructions that SLEIGH models
because the smallest object they can manipulate directly is a byte. In order to manipulate single
bits, p-code must use a combination of bitwise logical, extension, and truncation operations. So a
register defined as a bit range is not really a varnode as described in [Section 1.2,
“Varnodes”](sleigh.md#12-varnodes), but is really just a signal to the SLEIGH compiler to fill in
the proper operators to simulate the bit manipulation. Using this feature may greatly increase the
complexity of the compiled specification with little indication within the specification file
itself.

```
define register offset=0x180 size=4 [ statusreg ];
define bitrange zf=statusreg[10,1]
                cf=statusreg[11,1]
                sf=statusreg[12,1];
```

A bit range register must be defined on top of another normal register. In this example, *statusreg*
is defined first as a 4 byte register, and the bit registers themselves are built by the following
**define bitrange** statement. A single bit register definition consists of an identifier for the
register, followed by ‘=’, then the name of the register containing the bits, and finally a pair of
numbers in square brackets. The first number indicates the lowest significant bit in the containing
register of the bit range, where bit 0 is the least significant bit. The second number indicates the
number of bits in the new register. Multiple definitions can be included in a single **define
bitrange** statement, and the command is finally terminated with a semicolon. In the example, three
new registers are defined on top of *statusreg*, each made up of 1 bit. The new registers *zf*,
*cf*, and *sf* represent the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth bit of *statusreg* respectively.

The syntax for defining a new bit register is consistent with the pseudo bit range operator,
described in [Section 7.7.1.5, “Bit Range
Operator”](sleigh_constructors.md#7715-bit-range-operator), and the resulting symbol is really just
a placeholder for this operator. Whenever SLEIGH sees this symbol it generates p-code precisely as
if the designer had used the bit range operator instead. [Section 7.7.1.5, “Bit Range
Operator”](sleigh_constructors.md#7715-bit-range-operator), provides some additional details about
how p-code is generated, which apply to the use of bit range registers.

If a defined bit range happens to fall on byte boundaries, the new symbol will in fact be a normal
varnode, so the **define bitrange** statement can be used as an alternate syntax for defining
overlapping registers.

## 4.6. User-Defined Operations

The specification designer can define new p-code operations using a **define pcodeop** statement.
This statement automatically reserves an internal form for the new p-code operation and associates
an identifier with it. This identifier can then be used in semantic expressions (see [Section
7.7.1.8, “User-Defined Operations”](sleigh_constructors.md#7718-user-defined-operations)). The
following example defines a new p-code operation *arctan*.

```
define pcodeop arctan;
```

This construction should be used sparingly. The definition does not specify how the new operation is
supposed to actually manipulate data, and any analysis routines cannot know what the specification
designer intended. The operation will be treated as a black box. It will hold its place in syntax
trees, and the routines will understand how data flows into and out of it. But, no other analysis
will be possible.

New operations should be defined only after considering the above points and the general philosophy
of p-code. The designer should have a detailed description of the new operation in mind, even though
this cannot be put in the specification. If it all possible, the operation should be atomic, with
specific inputs and outputs, and with no side-effects. The most common use of a new operation is to
encapsulate actions that are too esoteric or too complicated to implement.
